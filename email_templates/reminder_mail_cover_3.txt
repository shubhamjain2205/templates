Hi {{name}},

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to follow up one last time for your Cover Story feature, **"{{title}}"**, in Frontier Blaze. After reviewing your achievements, I truly believe your story would inspire many.

To make this feature more accessible, we’ve adjusted the sponsorship to {{final_discount}}, covering essential editorial and promotional efforts - including publishing, global social media campaigns, and operational expenses.

The deadline for this edition is closing this weekend, and I’d love to include your journey. If you have any questions or need any adjustments to make this work, let me know - I’d be happy to accommodate.

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Warm regards,

{{bdm_name}} | Business Development Executive
