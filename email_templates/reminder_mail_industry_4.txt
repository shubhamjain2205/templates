Hi {{name}},

I wanted to reach out one last time for your **Industry Leading** feature in **Frontier Blaze**. I've carefully reviewed your incredible work, and I believe your story deserves to be featured.

To ensure budget isn't a barrier, I've arranged a final concession:

- **Original Sponsorship**: {{price}}
- **Exclusive Sponsorship**: {{final_discount}}

This discounted sponsorship is just to cover the essential expenses required to bring your story to everyone. It includes **editorial efforts, global social media campaigns,** and **operational expenses** to ensure the feature runs smoothly.
There are just few spots left, and I'd love to feature your journey. If there's anything you'd like to discuss, including adjustments to the title, details, or sponsorship, let me know, I'm happy to work with you to tailor this feature.

Excited about the possibility of collaborating!

Warm regards,
