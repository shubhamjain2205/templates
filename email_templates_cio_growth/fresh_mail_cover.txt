Dear {{name}},

I’m {{bdm_name}}, Partnerships Manager at CIO Growth. It is an honor to share that our editorial board has shortlisted you to be featured on the cover page of an upcoming Black Edition of CIO Growth's edition titled:

**"{{title}}"**

A CIO Growth Cover Story places you in front of a **global audience of senior leaders, founders, investors, and decision-makers** who actively consume our long-form features across web, email, and social platforms.	
Our editions consistently deliver **five-figure cumulative digital impressions**, long-term search visibility, and evergreen brand authority, not a one-week press mention.

Based on recent editions, a single cover feature typically receives:

- **Extensive digital reach:** Generates 30,000 - 50,000+ targeted impressions across web, email, and social channels, from a global audience of 25,000+ monthly page views including CEOs, Founders, Managing Directors, industry professionals, entrepreneurs, and engaged web followers.	
- **Global audience distribution:** 30% USA | 20% Canada | 20% Europe | 15% South Asia | 10% Australia | 5% other regions.	
- **Permanent online visibility:** Features include backlinks that continue driving brand discovery and SEO value over time.	
- **Newsletter amplification:** Monthly newsletters ensure features reach a highly relevant and attentive audience.

With that context, your profile aligns strongly with the editorial focus of this issue, which is curated to highlight leaders shaping the future of their industries through measurable impact and operational leadership.

**What this Cover Story delivers:**

**1. Front Cover Positioning**	
     Your image and story positioned as a leading voice within a globally distributed editorial edition.
	 
**2. Six-Page Editorial Feature**	
     A professionally written, narrative-driven feature focused on your journey, leadership decisions, and industry perspective.
	 
**3. Dedicated Online Feature Page**	
     A permanent profile hosted on Frontier Blaze with backlinks to your organization for continued visibility.
	 
**4. Multi-Channel Promotion**	
     Distribution across Frontier Blaze’s website, email campaigns, and social channels to extend reach beyond publication day.
	 
**5. Recognition Credentials**	
     An official certificate and digital recognition badge for professional use.
	 
**6. Extended Brand Exposure**	
     A complimentary full-page colour advertisement included in two subsequent editions.
	 
**7. Complimentary Physical Copies**	
     Two physical copies included with certificate.

This is not designed as a short-term promotion, but as a long-tail authority asset that continues to represent your leadership long after publication.	
The one-time investment for the complete editorial feature and distribution is **{{price}}**, covering editorial production, design, hosting, and post-publication promotion.

Please note that The Black Edition is strictly limited to a few distinguished leaders worldwide and is not open for general participation. As you've been shortlisted by our editorial team, we’d be honoured to showcase your story in this landmark edition. 

Let me know if you’d like me to confirm your inclusion and share the next steps.

Warm regards,
