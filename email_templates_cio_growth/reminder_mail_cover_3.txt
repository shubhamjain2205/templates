Dear {{name}},

As we enter the final stage of confirming our Black Edition leaders, I wanted to extend a final gesture of appreciation and flexibility.

If the recognition fee has been a concern, we are happy to offer you a **20% concession,** bringing your total to **${{discount_price}}** (reduced from ${{price}}), with all original benefits - PLUS the complimentary $300 Interview feature - still included.

We would truly love to have your vision featured in this historic editorial. If youâ€™d like to secure your spot or have any further questions, just reply to this message and I can take care of the rest right away.

Thank you again for considering this invitation.

Warm regards,
