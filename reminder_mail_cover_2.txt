Hi {{name}},

I've been thinking on how impactful your story is and how much it could inspire others if featured in **Frontier Blaze**. That's why I've worked with my team to make this cover feature even more accessible.

I've managed to secure a **special concession:**

-	**Original Sponsorship:** {{price}}
-	**After Concession:** {{discount_price}}

I understand that committing to a sponsorship may not sound appealing at first. But I want to assure you that this isn't about charging for the feature itself, it's for covering the **essential operational expenses** involved in making this feature a reality. These include:

-	**Publishing and editing** your story to perfection,
-	**Running targeted social media campaigns** to maximize your reach, and
-	**Supporting backend expenses** like magazine printing and platform hosting.

At **{{discount_price}}**, we're simply seeking sponsorship support for these **operational expenses**. Waiving the sponsorship entirely wouldn't allow us to sustain this platform and create opportunities like in the future.

This **special concession** is valid until this **weekend**, and I'd be happy to have you as part of this edition. Kindly let me know if you'd like to **secure your spot**. It would truly be an **honour** to share your **inspiring journey** with the world!

Warm regards,
