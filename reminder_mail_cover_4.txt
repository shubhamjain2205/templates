Hi {{name}},

I wanted to reach out one last time about your **Cover Story** feature titled, **"{{title}}"**  in **Frontier Blaze**. I've done my research on your **achievements**, and I believe your story deserves to be shared with the world.

To ensure **budget isn't a barrier**, I've spoken with my team and arranged a **final concession**:

-	**Original Sponsorship**: {{price}}
-	**Exclusive Sponsorship**: {{final_discount}}

This **reduced amount** is just to cover the **essential expenses** required to make this feature possible. It includes **editorial efforts, publishing your story, running global social media campaigns**, and **supporting the operational expenses** that bring everything together.

At **{{final_discount}}**, we're simply seeking support for these **essential expenses**. Waiving the sponsorship entirely wouldn't leave room for us to sustain the feature. I hope you'll consider this.

Just **few spots remains** for this edition, and I'd love to include your **journey**. If there's **anything holding you back**-whether it's the title, details, or sponsorship amount, kindly let me know. I'd be happy to work with you to **tailor this feature** to your preferences.

I'm genuinely excited about the potential collaboration!

Warm regards,
